# bluecrab-ibm
The code contains an individual-based molt-process model (Java with ECJ genetic algorithm optimization) for blue crabs in the Gulf of Mexico as developed for the 2013 GSMFC stock assessment model (GDAR-01).

Final GDAR report with (brief) description of model and its use in the assessment can be found here: http://www.gsmfc.org/publications/GSMFC%20Number%20215.pdf

See the ECJ documentation for how to run (starting point: params/bluecrabFull.params).

Notes: 
(1) Built circa 2012/2013 with Java 1.6 and ECJv20.
(2) This repo is primarily archival and provided as is for interested individuals, no futher development expected.  
(3) The data to run the model is not included in the repo (not mine to distribute), but a dedicated individual could figure out the structure from the code to run with their own.  It uses a heterogenous suite of data sources to optimize, others could be added if interesed.
